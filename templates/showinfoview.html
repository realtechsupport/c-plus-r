<i>Introduction</i>
<br><br>
Catch & Release (C+R) is a collection of procedures that allow you to apply machine learning classification to field videos.
C+Râ€™s goal is to facilitate the creation of under-represented knowledge in machine learning in general,
and experimental datasets for neural network image classification in particular.
C+R allows anyone with a mobile phone to create viable datasets for image classification
and to train state of the art convolutional neural networks with them.

<br><br>
Furthermore, C+R can extract text from video. It can extract labels from video and use them as labels for
image categories associated with the utterance.

<br><br>
C+R can help you create machine learning datasets or serve as a companion while studying convolutional neural network systems.
If you want to use it for a specific research need, for instructional purposes or if you would like to contribute to making a
global alternate image collection for machine learning training, contact the repository owner (marcbohlen@protnmail.com).

<br><br>
This software and the bali-26 dataset are the basis for the <a href='http://www.realtechsupport.org/new_works/return2bali.html'> Return to Bali</a>
project that explores machine learning to support the representation of ethnobotanical knowledge and practices in Central Bali.

<i>Technical Information</i>
<br><br>
C+R runs on Linux under Python3  and Flask with Chrome or Firefox. C+R uses the PyTorch framework to train and test the image classifiers.
Library versions and dependencies are given in the requirements.txt file. C+R has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 TLS with kernel 5.3.0 on
images sourced from .mp4 and .webm video formats (HD [1920 x 1080] at 30f/s; .mp4  H.264 encoded) from multiple (android OS)
mobile phones and GoPro Hero 6 action cameras.
<br><br>
Check the ReadMe file for descriptions of the individual modules within C+R.
